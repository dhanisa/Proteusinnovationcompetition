                        <p1>Problem</p1>
                        <p>Chronic pain is a rapidly growing epidemic that is believed to affect 18% of Canadian adults. Pain outcomes are evaluated on a 0-10 scale that is inadequate to describe a patient’s experience with pain. This creates a great challenge for both patients and clinicians, as understanding the experience of pain and subsequent treatment is not a simple task. 

                            Levis is a digital multidimensional symptom index that provides rapid phenotyping of each patient’s pain. It triangulates the frequency and interreference of 10 different factors of pain, giving rise to 120 health states that patients can use to describe their experience in a more meaningful way. As a user-friendly online application, it uses a survey to gather patient inputs. An algorithmic software combines the scores and outputs a radar plot, which summarizes individual patient phenotype and the broader phenotype subclass (Pain Group) which the patient belongs to. 
                            
                            Not only can Levis give a more wholistic picture on the pain experience of patients, it also gives clinicians a clearer picture of how to treat the symptoms. This is accomplished by leveraging Levis to re-measure patient pain following pain management treatments. Clinicians will use treatments that have worked within Pain Groups in the past to tailor treatments for future patients within the same group.  In summary, Levis is a digital pain management tool that 1) utilizes a comprehensive set of features to better pinpoint the pain patients experience and 2) provides tailored treatment options most likely to work on patients.

                        <p>The progression of pain can be classified in three stages: emergent, acute, and chronic. The emergent state of pain is when the pain initially manifests, like at an accident. Acute pain lasts for a short period of time, typically for less than 6 months, after the emergent state of pain is exhibited. Finally, the chronic pain state is the most severe, and lasts for more than 6 months.

                            The primary target market of Levis are individuals in the acute stage of pain. More specifically, the tool is intended to target patients who have exhibited emergent pain symptoms and are in the first month of experiencing acute pain. The goal is to use Levis’ superior diagnostic and treatment technology to help patients manage pain in a way that prevents the likelihood of them developing chronic pain. Once established, patients in the secondary market, or patients with chronic pain, can be targeted to deliver multifaceted pain diagnosis and provide tailored treatment options. These preventative measures will directly address the epidemic that is chronic pain both in Canada and globally.
